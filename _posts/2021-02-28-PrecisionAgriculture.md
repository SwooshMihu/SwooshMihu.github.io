“You can't manage what you can't measure.”

## Context

"Good soil is the start of good agriculture and without good agriculture everything else goes away." Every agronomist is aware of the fact that every succesful culture requires great care and attention. Like any other living organism, to properly grow, develop and express themselves, plants need quality nutrients in precise amounts. In the case of plants, those 3 vital nutrients are N, K and P. Depending on the growth stage of the plant, for optimal development a certain value of the N:K:P raport is required and today, in Romania, no technology is used to properly measure the quantity of nutrients in the soil in which crops grow.

This practice of precision agriculture - the ability to create maps of spatial variability of as many variables as can be measured (e.g. organic matter contant, moisture level, pH, NPK levels, Mg and others) - allows farmers to optimally distribute resources as to ensure optimal growth for their crops and to avoid unnecessary expenditures on fertilizers(that can rack up some serious $$) that not only will not benefit the plant (e.g. the case in which the farmer uses N based fertilizers when the plant requires a higher amount of K), but they can stress the crop, resulting in lower yields.

## The Plan

I have decided to run a 5 days sprint, from monday to friday
